# 5-Day Implementation Plan: AI-Powered Talent Pipeline
(Non-Technical Implementation Guide)

## Important Notes:
1. NEVER delete your original files until new ones are working
2. Keep a backup folder of your original files
3. When implementing changes, we'll first test them before replacing anything
4. File names will stay the same unless absolutely necessary (in which case, you'll get clear instructions)

- Implement data validation
- Add learning metrics collection
```

### Day 2
Session 1:

- Update feedback rules
- Implement feedback caching
- Improve response evaluation
```

Session 2:

## Development Environment Setup

1. VSCode Setup:
   - Install Python extension
   - Install Git extension
   - Install MongoDB extension for easy database viewing

2. GitHub Integration:
   - Ensure your repository is connected
   - Use VSCode's source control panel for commits
   - Test changes locally before pushing

3. Render & MongoDB Atlas:
   - Keep your connection strings safe in .env
   - Test database changes locally first
   - Update Render environment variables as needed

## Implementation Process for Each Session:

1. Start a new chat with Claude
2. Copy the relevant prompt
3. Copy and paste ALL the required files for that session
4. Follow Claude's implementation instructions
5. Save new/updated files with clear names
6. Test changes before replacing any original files
7. Keep backup copies of all original files

## File Management Tips:

1. Create folders for each day:
   - Day1_Data
   - Day2_Feedback
   - Day3_Tasks
   - Day4_Dashboard
   - Day5_Integration

2. In each folder, maintain:
   - Original (backup of original files)
   - Working (files you're currently updating)
   - Final (tested and working files)

3. Only move files to 'Final' after testing
