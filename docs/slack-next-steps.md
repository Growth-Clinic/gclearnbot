## Next Steps and Prompts:

### Message Handling Enhancement:

"I need to enhance the message handling in handlers.py to better handle lesson responses and user interactions. Here's my handlers.py file - what specific modifications are needed to improve message processing while maintaining the existing functionality?"

### Lesson Navigation:

"Looking at my current content_loader.py, how can I modify it to better support Slack's message formatting and button navigation while keeping compatibility with the existing Telegram implementation?"

### Progress Tracking Integration:

"I want to integrate the progress tracking system with Slack. Looking at my progress_tracker.py, what changes are needed to support both Telegram and Slack users while maintaining the current functionality?"

### Database Schema Update:

"I need to update the database schema in database.py to include Slack-specific fields. What specific changes should I make to support Slack users while maintaining backward compatibility?"

### Command Implementation:

"Based on my commands.py file, what additional commands should I implement for Slack, and how should I structure them to maintain consistency with the existing system?"
Each of these prompts will help us implement the remaining features while maintaining the simplicity and functionality of the current system. Would you like me to proceed with any specific one of these areas?

### Polishing: Basic Analytics:

"You mentioned setting up basic analytics when we drew up the plan, what did you mean then and how can we do that keeping with the existing system and letting everything be simple?"
