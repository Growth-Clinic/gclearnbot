ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Implement Fast Browser-Based NLP (Word Similarity Matching)
For this, we'll:
âœ… Use wink-nlp (lightweight, fast, and optimized for mobile).
âœ… Apply word similarity matching instead of strict keyword matching.
âœ… Lazy-load NLP so the site still loads fast.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Later, Add a Server-Side NLP Fallback
If the user's device is slow, weâ€™ll send the request to the backend for better processing.
This will use Python NLP (e.g., spaCy or DistilBERT) for more advanced word understanding.
