I am trying to finish up registering and login in and login out, so I can test the other features of the web app. I hit an error and it seems easy but I am tired, so I paused for now. The error detail is this:

On registering, the site displays a dialog box saying: 

`Registration failed: Server error`

The Browser Console shows 2 errors, one related to the failed registration process and another tied to loadlessons that I will have to look into later:

```

I was working on this with ChatGPT here: https://chatgpt.com/c/67a90af6-dff4-800e-a055-d677c8cf17d7

And Claude is uptodate with my files

### 6:20 AM

I am trying to finish up being able to load lessons on the web app, but that isn't working the browser console is showing this error:

```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML')
    at fetchLessons (app.js:143:36)
    at async initializeApp (app.js:259:9)
```

While that is blocked, I want to copy some of the styling, images, illustrations and branding from growthclinic.xyz to this new web app, and make this the main Growth Clinic. I'll share the files with Claude so it can help me figure out a way. Maybe I'll also need to share full page screenshots of the site and its different pages to help? And also, I want there to be different pages for the web app, so there would be the landing page and then the learning dashboard page. Later on we can look at a proper journal page and a proper progress page.

Claude is up-to-date with my edited files

The prompt I am thinking of using with Claude for the website design remake is this:

"I need your help as an expert web designer, frontend software engineer and digital marketer to copy some of the designs and brandings from my old website to this one. I have all the files, but I don't know which ones to share. So I have taken screenshots of a couple of the pages (desktop and mobile) and attached them here, I have also added the html files of the pages so you get a sense of what the site is made of. I added the desktop and mobile versions of the page and indicated this in the naming of the files. The mobile page screenshots are too long/large so I combined them into a PDF. In this PDF, the operator mobile page is first, followed by the about page and then the home page. Use these to let me know what I should share and how to migrate it to this project.

I'd also want to split the current web page into a landing page and then the different learning pages (learning dashboard, journal and progress) and add a contact link to the brand email growthclinic@gmail.com. Let me know what you think?

Just to give a recap or context so you don't copy content that is no longer applicable, the goal is so users learn from the app and then they pay to get or unlock personalisation. With personalisation they'd be able to see possible futures with respect to their learning and what they need or are lacking to get there. Basically, our enhanced feedback on steriods. They'd also get access to a guide who's an expert in the field they are looking to grow in, and get weekly calls where they'd get additional help on anything they need it for. Pricing for this is 50,000 NGN monthlt, but it is at a discount to 20,000 NGN. This can be visually shown with a cross or slash on the 50k and 20k being shown. It is a marketing gimmick."

### 7:05 PM

I have fixed the registration and loading lessons issues, now I am trying to fix the appearance of lessons. THis is the prompt I plan to send to Claude or ChatGPT to help me resolve the issues:

"Yes! Thank you! Lessons load fine now.

A few fixes.

1. Just like how we did with Telegram, only loading the start of each lesson and naming them in the selector with their short enticing descriptions, let's do the same here.
2. When one selects a lesson from the dropdown, can it automatically load the lesson instead of having to click a button first?
3. Can the Your Progress, Your Journal not sure until Ihave progress or journals?
4. Can the submit your response not sure unless I am viewing a lesson?
5. Can the lesson selector disappear or fade out and the lesson display show afterwards? This would give it a cleaner more immersive viewing and persusing experience.
6. The lessons are formatted and arranged for IM, can they be formatted for web so they have paragraphs and appear with spacing and all that like they did in Telegram?
7. Can we have next and previous buttons so users can scroll through the lessons and their steps? We can have a tooltip or some gentle notice telling them that filling replies for the steps that require them is the only way we can help them learn and find where they need to improve. They'll need to journal. Maybe we can limit this gentle notice or prompt to steps that require a reply.
8. The navbar after logging in stacks the Learning, Progress and Journal links horizontally on themselves in a not so pleasing appearance. Can this be fixed?
9. I've been wondering if I should show a different list of lessons to users on the web so I can clean up the text and word it to match this design. Because there are a couple of lessons where we say Tap or so to begin or Reply [emoji] to continue or something along those lines. I am asking that we discuss this as you are an expert on learning pedagogy and learning product design and engagement."

### 9:05 PM

I have fixed lessons displaying and I can go through them, and the burger menu is working now on all the protected pages. But the feedback/replies I send are not going through, they are throwing an error. That is the journals are not saving. Progress too is not saving. When I try to send feedback I get an error message in the browser: `Error: Server Error` and in the browser console I see: 

```
app.js:588 
            
            
            POST https://gclearnbot.onrender.com/lessons/lesson_2/response 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

In the deploy logs I see:

```

```

---

When I click to load journal, I get an error in browser console but no error in the browser. Console shows:

```
app.js:699 
            
            
            GET https://gclearnbot.onrender.com/journal 500 (Internal Server Error)

```

In the deploy logs I see:

```

---

When I click to load progress, I get an error in browser console. In the browser, the text changes to show "No progress data yet! Start ..." even though I have gone through some lessons. Console shows:

```
app.js:639 
 
 GET https://gclearnbot.onrender.com/progress 500 (Internal Server Error)

```

In the deploy logs I see:

```

    with app.app_context():

```

---

A few other things I noticed: 

- Clicking logout doesn't redirect me to the homepage, it should.
- When logged out, loading any of the protected pages should redirect to the homepage
- Protected pages shouldn't show on the homepage when logged out
- THe burger menu doesn't work on just the homepage

#### Checking lessons

When I send a response to a lesson, I get these errors:

#### Checking journals

When I load journals, it shows the No journal entries message which is true and good, but it still throws errors. Is the 500 error supposed to show if there are no journal entries?

#### Checking progress

When I do the same for progress, it shows the no progress data yet which is true and good, but I get errors. Is the 500 error showing because there is no progress data?

## 13 Feb 2025

### 11:12 PM

It seems all the UI issues on the web app are finally done! It looks pretty and all the buttons and links are appearing where they should. 

The next thing I need to fix is the backend for both the Telegram and Web App. I need to go through them one by one and fix each issue one by one, no rush. I'll prioritise the Web App and ensure it is working fully, then I'll move on to the next best channel for the product. 

I am prioritising the web app because it is the most accessible for people who I'd want to show it to. And allows me build a more sophisticated learning experience.

So I need the lesson responses saving to journal, feedback being presented to the user, and progress being captured. As I looked at the issue with ChatGPT, it seems my biggest issue is user_ids are missing from the user document and Claude didn't realise this, it just assumed it was there. This cause Claude to kepp sending me in circles of fixing different things and meeting the same error.

So next I'll work on:
- Fixing user_ids being missing in the user document in mongodb
- Ensuring lessons' responses saving to journal, feedback being presented to the user, and progress being captured




## 14 Feb 2025

### 3:13 AM

In trying to fix the missing user_id, Claude has created new code and it seems to be calling functions not yet created and implementing code other existing functions have some functionality in. So when I am back, I want to tell it to check that other similar functions don't exist in the code, so it does not create code that isn't needed.




## 14 Feb 2025

### 5:29 PM

I was finally able to get responses saved and journals and progress displaying! But then like I had done before, I rushed and worked on a large chunk of work and this caused the app to break. And because the work was large and combining too many things, I couldn't figure out clearly what was broken. I need to learn incremental work alongside my focused work. I mention focus because I realised that was what was causing the issues I was having with Claude, I wasn't given it focused work and so it was scattered in its implementation. I'll reverse the code and start implementing the changes I want incrementally while focusing completely on the current goal of finishing the web app.




## 15 Feb 2025

### 2:02 AM

I am super tired as I type this, so please excuse me. I was able to revert the code and work on the styling incrementally. That worked well and now they are all styled. I just need to figure out how to get and show/display feedback on the user's end.




## 16 Feb 2025

### 3:43 PM

I stopped working on the app to get a change of pace. It is at a good place to show the basic idea I have, and my head is to full to think through how to finish up displaying feedback to users, so I paused it for now.

I have been thinking seriously about how to make the most of the project and publicising my efforts and work has been a recurring idea. This is why I initially wanted to publish a research paper, but writing a book seems simpler and if I do the book well, I could even make money from it. So I started writing a book on the system and process behind this project; GIS and GIOS and it is going fine. 

I have finished with introduction and chapter 1, and I am currently on chapter 2 when I reached my limits on Claude. Let me document my notes on the chapter 2, so I can continue from there when I come back.

#### Notes on chapter 2
- Instead of How Communities Become Markets, let's change that heading to How Communities Create Markets. It is more fitting.
- In the write up for altMBA, they use digital tools like Slack, Discourse, and Zoom. They've stopped using WordPress as they said it was hard to allow different people to engage on the lessons with WordPress which shows them trying to enable and create the space for many to many interactions. 
- Is there a way we can add some of the story bits I noted about altMBA? Like I had interview Marie Schacht when she was the provost there and she said gave some interesting insights like:

“People add the learning time to their calendars and for them, it is time with other people, not just time to learn”

“Members who completed courses 4 years ago still keep in touch and meet up with others they met in the week 1 groups”

Why these insights were useful to me was that they showed how the interactions they enabled created connections and bonds between their members and in most cases, bonds to the brand itself. It is bonds like these that make a brand a de-facto stabdard or household name in their industry.

- In some places where we use community as the name, the words it represents can be better suited there. So I was wondering if we could put those words in bracket. For instance in The Future of Community-Led Growth where we say: "The communities that thrive will be those that:", we could write this part as: "The communities (individuals, businesses, organisations, countries) that thrive will be those that:"

### 9:21 PM

#### Notes on chapter 4
- Add this title to Sean Burrowes; Sean Burrowes (former COO at Ingressive and Director of Business Development at Semicolon), or something along these lines.
- In Value Creation under How These Components Work Together, change "Community members identify local problems" to "Partners and Community members identify local problems"

---

I've made the edits to chapter 4 and saved them both in the project files and on GitHub, after my limits reset, I'll start work on Part 2 of the book which starts with chapter 5.




## 17 Feb 2025

### 12:39 AM
Okay, I have gotten to the parts of the book that are purely ideas, like visions of what could be. I'll need the masters' help in understand how best to present this part. Till later in the day then.

### 11:49 AM
I am making progress with the book, so much so, that I can share it for others to help me review. Now I'd like to get it in the hands of a non-techie, a techie, a senior techie, a senior manager and someone with a PhD.

### 4:18 PM
I have gotten to the appendices of the book! Yippee! A few things I want to correct when my limits are reset on Claude:

1. Give an updated outline with the appendices we've created
2. Share the community experience map template Google sheet to claude so it can take more insights from there to improve appendix A
   1. To further improve appendix A, can there be a fictional story (and it will be stated that the story is fictional, completely AI-generated), that helps to make the framework relatable? Right now it just feels like I am reading lists and lists.
3. Add the Gigson story to Appendix B, so we'd have 4 case studies. And it should share the full story for each and then give the key patterns, background, innovation process and all.

### 9:14 PM
- Can we paginate the journals page so it is easier to browse through long entries?




## 18 Feb 2025

### 3:45 AM
It seems the stemming and synonym feature isn't working on responses, I'll need to look into that. I am also beginning to think I should restart my Job Auto-Applier tool I was building back then, since I have gotten this learning app to a point where I am okay with it. I'll also have to fix the Telegram issue too though before then.

### 3:21 PM
THis is the console log. It would seem the keywords are not matching as well, and I don't want to keep updating the lemmatize function manually. Would an SLM or LLM via an API be better or what would you suggest for a smoother expereince where the users who talked very different from each other but leave in a place with low connectivity can get good actionable feedback, but for the app, it would still be free and easy to implement?

So I am done with adding better analysis of user's response and set up dynamic templates to send pseudo-personal feedback to users. For the next part of the app, I'd like to improve the user progress dashboard with the extra data we have, and then do an admin dashboard to see user details. 

But I'll wait on those. Instead I'll start working on pushing out the app for people to test and collect feedback. Then based off the feedback, I'll launch proper, maybe use my custom domain and push everything out well 🤞🏾
