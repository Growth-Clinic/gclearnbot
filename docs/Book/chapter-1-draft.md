# Chapter 1: Understanding Mental Models

Before we dive in, let's expand our understanding of what we mean by "community." When we talk about communities, we're not just referring to groups of people gathering around shared interests. A community could be:
- An individual and their network of relationships
- A tech startup and its ecosystem of users, developers, and partners
- An organization and its stakeholders
- An international NGO and the populations it serves
- A country and its various systems
- A government agency and its constituents

In each case, whether they realise it or not, these communities operate through shared ways of thinking - mental models that help them understand and interact with the world around them. These aren't just abstract concepts; they're practical tools that shape how communities solve problems, create value, and grow together.

### What Are Mental Models?

Think of mental models as the lenses through which we view and understand the world. They're the frameworks we use to:
- Make sense of new information
- Solve problems
- Make decisions
- Create new possibilities

For example, at Devcenter, we observed how developers approached problem-solving differently based on their mental models:
- Some saw coding purely as writing instructions for computers
- Others viewed it as creating solutions for human needs
- The most successful ones understood it as building value for users

These different mental models led to vastly different outcomes, even when working with the same technical skills.

### How Communities Create and Evolve Mental Models

The fascinating aspect of communities is how they naturally develop and share mental models. This process typically follows a pattern:

1. Individual Discovery
   - A community member encounters a challenge
   - They find or create a solution
   - Their approach reflects their understanding of the problem

2. Community Sharing
   - The solution is shared with others
   - Community members discuss and question the approach
   - Different perspectives emerge and enrich the original thinking

3. Collective Refinement
   - The community tests the approach in different contexts
   - The mental model evolves through practical application
   - A shared understanding emerges

4. Model Integration
   - The refined thinking becomes part of community knowledge
   - New members adopt and further evolve these models
   - The community's collective capability grows

Take the example of the dance studio we mentioned earlier. What began as a place to learn dance moves evolved into a community with shared mental models about:
- How movement connects to emotion
- The role of dance in cultural expression
- Building confidence through physical artistry
- Creating economic opportunities through shared passion

These mental models went far beyond dance techniques, creating a foundation for community growth and economic development.

### The Role of Mental Models in Innovation

Mental models don't just help communities understand existing realities - they're crucial for creating new possibilities. Innovation often happens when communities:
- Combine different mental models in unique ways
- Apply models from one domain to another
- Evolve existing models to meet new challenges

The taco restaurant story illustrates this perfectly. They evolved from:
- A traditional restaurant model focused on food service
- To a community hub model centred on cultural exchange
- To an economic engine model supporting local entrepreneurs

Each evolution represented a shift in mental models, opening new possibilities for growth and value creation.

### Why Mental Models Matter for Community Growth

Understanding mental models is crucial for community development because they:

1. Accelerate Learning
   - New members can quickly adopt proven ways of thinking
   - The community can build on existing knowledge rather than starting fresh
   - Learning becomes more efficient and effective

2. Enable Innovation
   - Shared understanding creates a foundation for new ideas
   - Different perspectives can combine to create novel solutions
   - The community becomes more adaptible to change

3. Create Economic Opportunities
   - Common frameworks help identify market needs
   - Shared understanding facilitates collaboration
   - Community knowledge can be transformed into valuable products or services

4. Build Sustainable Growth
   - Mental models help communities navigate challenges
   - Shared thinking patterns strengthen community bonds
   - Knowledge can be passed on to new generations

### Case Study: The Five-Star Dilemma

"I can't give him a low rating na; that's where he eats. I'm not a bad person!"

I was puzzled. We had just stepped out of an Uber at our office in Surulere, Lagos. The driver had been rude and driven recklessly throughout the journey, yet here was my boss giving him a five-star rating. When I questioned this generous rating despite our less-than-stellar experience, my boss's response perfectly captured a uniquely Nigerian perspective.

This wasn't the only surprising encounter I had with rating systems. On an urban exploration with a friend, we'd just finished a delicious meal at a newly discovered restaurant. As I happily tapped five stars on Google Maps, I noticed my friend giving only three stars.

"Three stars?" I asked, bewildered.

He looked at me very seriously. "I give three stars to a good place where they did what they said they'd do and the experience was satisfactory. Four stars are for places that go above and beyond." Then, with absolute conviction, he added, "Then five stars is for God; only God is perfect."

I had to laugh - but I also had to admit it made perfect sense! Why indeed was I giving out so many five-star ratings? Only God is perfect, after all!

Yet another friend revealed her own approach to ratings: she simply couldn't be bothered unless something was exceptionally good or notably bad. The middle ground? Not worth the effort of tapping those stars. An Uber driver later confided that he did the same - mindlessly giving five stars regardless of the rider, simply because the system required it.

What these stories reveal are three distinct ways of thinking - three mental models - that shape how Nigerians interact with rating systems:

1. "We are our brother's keeper"
   - The belief that giving low ratings, even when deserved, might harm someone's livelihood
   - A reflection of our deep-seated value of community support

2. "Only God deserves perfection"
   - The cultural and religious perspective that perfection belongs to the divine
   - A framework that transforms how we evaluate excellence

3. "If it's not remarkable, it's not worth rating"
   - The pragmatic approach that only extremes deserve attention
   - A mindset that reshapes how feedback systems work in practice

These mental models show us something crucial about building community systems: what works in one cultural context might need significant rethinking in another. A rating system designed to ensure quality through consistent feedback runs into interesting challenges when it meets Nigerian cultural values.

But here's the real insight: these aren't "problems" to fix - they're valuable clues about how communities naturally think and behave. Understanding these mental models helps us:
- Design systems that align with cultural values rather than fight against them
- Recognize how local perspectives can inform better community tools
- Appreciate the importance of cultural context in community building

After all, a system that doesn't account for the fact that "only God deserves five stars" might be missing something important about how its community views the world!

### Looking Forward

Understanding mental models sets the foundation for everything that follows in this book. They are:
- The building blocks of community learning
- The basis for value creation
- The seeds of innovation
- The framework for sustainable growth
- The key to creating culturally relevant solutions

In the next chapter, we'll explore how these mental models play out in practice through community-led growth, examining how communities naturally evolve from places of connection into engines of economic development.
