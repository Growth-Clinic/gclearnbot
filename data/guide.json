They will be your \"user\" throughout this exercise.\n\n✅ Prep Task:\nWe are going to be working on improving the gift-giving experience for someone, that is to help them come up with better ways to give gifts. You can use this in any other situation or experience you want to improve.\n\n1. Get a notebook or voice recorder to capture their responses.\n2. Ask about their last gift-giving experience:\n   - \"What happened?\"\n   - \"How did you choose the gift?\"\n   - \"What was hard or easy about the process?\"\n\nNote interesting points. Share one insight you found surprising! 📝\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n- This process can also be used to improve customer support experiences, employee onboarding, or even public transportation systems. Think about how you can adapt these questions to other contexts!",
