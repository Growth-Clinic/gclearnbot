You’ll learn how to understand their needs, define the problem, and come up with creative solutions.\n\n✅ Why This Matters:\n- You can use this process to improve any experience—not just gift-giving.\n- It’s a powerful way to solve real-world problems by focusing on the user’s perspective.\n\nHere's the 5-step breakdown:\n1. Empathise: Understand your user's perspective and feelings. 🤝\n2. Define: Identify the core problem or challenge. 🎯\n3. Ideate: Brainstorm creative solutions. 💡\n4.

Emotions and Decision-Making:\n   - Emotions are integral to rational thinking. Studies show that people with damage to the amygdala (the part of the brain that regulates emotions) struggle to make even basic decisions. This highlights that decisions are not purely logical but are deeply influenced by emotions.\n   - Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to perceive, understand, and manage emotions. It helps us prioritize what truly matters and build healthy relationships.\n\n2. Emotions in Action:\n   - Negative emotions like loneliness, boredom, or dissatisfaction often trigger specific behaviors. For example, people check social media when they feel lonely or Google when they feel uncertain.\n   - Positive emotions, like happiness, can make people more social and creative, while anxiety can help focus attention on immediate tasks.\n\n✅ Task: Reflect on how emotions influence your own decisions. Write down one example of a decision you made recently that was driven by an emotion (e.g., buying something because it made you happy or avoiding a task because it caused anxiety).\n\nReply with your example 📝",

        "text": "🎣 Step 2: Introducing the Hooked Model\n\nThe Hooked Model is a framework for creating habit-forming products. It consists of four phases: Trigger, Action, Reward, and Investment.\n\nKey Concepts:\n1. Triggers:\n   - External Triggers: These are cues in the environment, like notifications or ads, that prompt users to take action.\n   - Internal Triggers: These are emotions or situations that drive users to seek a solution. For example, feeling bored might trigger someone to open a social media app.\n\n2. Action:\n   - The simplest behavior done in anticipation of a reward. For example, scrolling through a feed or clicking a button.\n   - According to BJ Fogg’s Behavior Model, for an action to occur, users need sufficient motivation, ability, and a trigger.\n\n3. Variable Reward:\n   - Rewards that are unpredictable keep users engaged. There are three types of variable rewards:\n     - Rewards of the Tribe: Social rewards, like likes or comments on social media.\n     - Rewards of the Hunt: The search for resources or information, like scrolling through a news feed.\n     - Rewards of the Self: Intrinsic rewards, like the satisfaction of completing a task or leveling up in a game.\n\n4. Investment:\n   - Users invest time, data, or effort into a product, which increases the likelihood of them returning. For example, building a profile or saving content creates value that keeps users coming back.\n\n✅ Task:\nThink of a product you use habitually (e.g., a social media app or a game).

Motivation:\n   - Users are motivated by seeking pleasure, avoiding pain, seeking hope, avoiding fear, and seeking social acceptance.\n\n3. Ability:\n   - To increase the likelihood of a behavior, make it easier to do. This can involve reducing the time, cost, or effort required.\n\n4.
