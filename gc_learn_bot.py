1️⃣ Empathise: Understand your user's perspective and feelings
2️⃣ Define: Identify the core problem or challenge
3️⃣ Ideate: Brainstorm creative solutions
4️⃣ Prototype: Develop an initial version of your solution
5️⃣ Test: Get user feedback and refine your ideas

2. Write an Insights List: What stood out to you during the interview?

3. Combine items in both the Needs List and the Insights List to craft a Problem Statement:
   - Example: "Ali needs a way to make the most of his time (Need), but he struggles with managing it effectively (Insight)."
