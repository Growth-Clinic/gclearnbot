👋 Welcome to Design Thinking! This lesson helps you learn and apply the 5-step process for understanding and solving user problems. Here's the breakdown:

1️⃣ Empathise: Understand your user's perspective and feelings
2️⃣ Define: Identify the core problem or challenge
3️⃣ Ideate: Brainstorm creative solutions
4️⃣ Prototype: Develop an initial version of your solution
5️⃣ Test: Get user feedback and refine your ideas

✅ Prep Task:
1. Get a notebook or voice recorder to capture their responses.
2. Ask about their last gift-giving experience:
   - "What happened?"
   - "How did you choose the gift?"
   - "What was hard or easy about the process?"

2. Write an Insights List: What stood out to you during the interview?
   - These are the things you noticed would be helpful in improving that experience for your user.
3. Combine items in both the Needs List and the Insights List to craft a Problem Statement:
   - Example: "Ali needs a way to make the most of his time (Need), but he struggles with managing it effectively (Insight)."
